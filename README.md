# Programming Assignment 4

This repository contains an R script (run_analysis.R) to create a tidy data set from the [UCI HAR Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata\%2Fprojectfiles\%2FUCI\%20HAR\%20Dataset.zip), and finally a dataset containing the averages of the variables in the first data set for each subject over each activity (averagesActSubj.csv).

This script should be run from a folder containing the UCI HAR Dataset folder.

Codebook.md describes the variables and the process by which the final tidy dataset was made.
